This exercise will test your JS and unit testing skills. The goal is to make all the unit tests pass. 
The implementation code (utils/signatureParser.js) aims to isolate the latest reply from an email thread, stripping out email signatures and nested replies.

There are 4 test cases. Three of them pass currently. You'll need to modify the implementation code so that the fourth test passes as well.

To get started, run `npm install`
and then `npm run test` to run the tests.
